# Portfolio-Revamp
This is a revamp of my old Wix portfoilo where I used Wix to create a website to display my projects and designs as my html and css wasnt the best leaving college.
This updated Portfolio is created on the bootstrap framework but most of the css is custom as I wanted to see how far my html, css and javascipt have improved over the past year.
I also wanted to display my digital designs in a gallery to display my work in one place

## Lessons learned
for this Portfolio redesign I went with writing my own CSS, I learnt a lot about responsive design the idea of mobile first. 
I was tested on my design skills to find the best fitting colours and UI look to represent my skills and work.
i ran into many promblems creating my own css so i used bootstraps containers to help me have a bit more controller over my UI.


## Potential future features
I hope to be able to remove the bootstrap containers to support my design and have a more lively design to add more of my charcater.
Add more designs to my gallery like my figma designs and video edits.
As I improve my design of websites I want to give my design a more bold look.

### deployment
Deployed on Github Pages.

### Working on
Cleaning up UI and preparing for deployment with projects. 
I need to work on the clean up of the code as it was updated over months and my way of devlopment has changed so I need to clean up and sort out the files.
I need to also focus on the performance of the page like change images format and adding better accessibility. 
Sort out responsive design.
Cleaning up vectors for gallery and finishing logo design
adding dark mode.
