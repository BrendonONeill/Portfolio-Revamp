# Portfolio-Revamp
This is a revamp of my old Wix portfoilo where I used Wix to create a website to display my projects and designs as my html and css wasnt the best leaving college.
This updated Portfolio is created on the bootstrap framework but most of the css is custom as I wanted to see how far my html, css and javascipt have improved over the past year.
