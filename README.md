# Portfolio-Revamp
This is a revamp of my old Wix portfoilo where I used Wix to create a website to display my projects and designs as my html and css wasnt the best leaving college.
This updated Portfolio is created on the bootstrap framework but most of the css is custom as I wanted to see how far my html, css and javascipt have improved over the past year.

## Lessons learned
for this Portfolio redesign I went with writing my own CSS, I learnt a lot about responsive design the idea of mobile first. 
I was tested on my design skills to find the best fitting colours and UI look to represent my skills and work.
i ran into many promblems creating my own css so i used bootstraps containers to help me have a bit more controller over my UI.


## Potential future features
I hope to be able to remove the bootstrap containers to support my design and have a more lively design to add more of my charcater.
Add more designs to my gallery like my figma designs and video edits.
As I improve my design of websites I want to give my design a more bold look.
